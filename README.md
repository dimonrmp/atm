# ATM machine


### What the project does?
The exercise of building ATM machine app teaches how to  
* 1. Implement user-friendly UI and React components
- 2. Manage state of various UI elements
3. Validate form content in conjunction with state of other components

To improve the app I 
    - 1. Added validation so users canâ€™t withdraw more money than the account balance
    - 2. Modifyed the user interface to require users to select deposit or withdraw before an input field is visible
    - 3. After each form submission or ATM mode change, the input field for deposit is reset to 0

### Installation/How to run
Clone the project, run the local web-server, open index.html


### Roadmap of future improvements
It's a required exercise and part of the course and I will continue development of this project as/if necessary.
